## Introduction

> This dataset deals with pollution in the U.S. Pollution in the U.S. has been well documented by the U.S. EPA but it is a pain to download all the data and arrange them in a format that interests data scientists. Hence I gathered four major pollutants (Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulphur Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide and Ozone) for every day from 2000 - 2016 and place them neatly in a CSV file.
