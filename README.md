## Introduction

> This dataset deals with pollution in the U.S. Pollution in the U.S. has been well documented by the U.S. EPA but it is a pain to download all the data and arrange them in a format that interests data scientists. Hence I gathered four major pollutants (Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulphur Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide and Ozone) for every day from 2000 - 2016 and place them neatly in a CSV file.

## Dataset

Our dataset includes historical AQI data with key measurements for pollutants such as Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), and Carbon Monoxide (CO). The data also includes information about the year, month, and location (city and state) of each measurement.

## Methodology

We explore different machine learning models for this task, including:

- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

Each model is trained on our dataset and then used to make predictions about future AQI levels. The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics like R2 Score, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Normalized RMSE.

## Results for Regression Models

The table summarizes the performance of four different models (Random Forest, Linear Regression, MLP, XGBoost) across four different pollutants (NO2, O3, SO2, CO). The metrics used for evaluation are Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2).

1. Model Performance Comparison:
   - **XGBoost consistently outperforms other models** in terms of lower MSE and higher R2 values across all pollutants. This suggests that XGBoost is the most accurate model for predicting pollutant levels.
   - **Random Forest is the second-best performer**, showing good balance between MSE, MAE, and R2 values, but slightly less effective than XGBoost.
   - **Linear Regression performs poorly** compared to ensemble methods (Random Forest and XGBoost), indicating it may not capture the complexity in the data as well.
   - **MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) performs the worst**, with the highest MSE and lowest (often negative) R2 values, indicating it is not suitable for this dataset.

2. Pollutant-wise Observations:
   - **NO2 Mean:** XGBoost has the best performance (MSE: 0.376, R2: 0.616), while MLP has the worst (MSE: 1.632, R2: -0.670).
   - **O3 Mean:** XGBoost again leads (MSE: 0.479, R2: 0.522), with MLP showing poor performance (MSE: 1.105, R2: -0.103).
   - **SO2 Mean:** XGBoost and Random Forest are close in performance, with XGBoost slightly better (MSE: 0.457, R2: 0.526).
   - **CO Mean:** XGBoost performs best (MSE: 0.398, R2: 0.586), with MLP having the poorest results (MSE: 1.156, R2: -0.201).

### Observations

1. **Trends Over Time:**
   - The actual CO mean levels (blue bars) show a decreasing trend over the observed period, indicating an overall improvement in air quality in terms of CO levels.
   - The predicted CO mean levels (orange bars) closely follow the actual data, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in capturing the trend and variations in CO levels.

2. **Model Performance:**
   - The prediction bars (orange) generally align well with the actual bars (blue), suggesting that the model has good accuracy for historical data.
   - The future predicted values (green bars) continue the downward trend, indicating that the model anticipates further improvements in CO levels.

3. **Trend Line:**
   - The red dashed line represents the trend over the entire period, reinforcing the observed decrease in CO levels.

### Insights

1. **Accuracy and Reliability:**
   - The model demonstrates high accuracy, as evidenced by the close alignment between the actual and predicted values for the historical period.
   - This accuracy instills confidence in the model's future predictions.

2. **Future Predictions:**
   - The predicted future values suggest continued improvement in CO levels. If the model's assumptions hold, we can expect further reductions in CO pollution in New York City.
   - Policy makers and environmental agencies can use these predictions for planning and implementing further air quality improvements.

3. **Model Application:**
   - This analysis is useful for urban planners, environmentalists, and public health officials. Accurate predictions help in understanding the impact of current policies and in making informed decisions for future interventions.
